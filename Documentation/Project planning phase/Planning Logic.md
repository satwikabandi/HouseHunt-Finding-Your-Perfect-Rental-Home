# Planning Logic

Project planning defines the structured approach followed during the
development of the **House Hunt – Apartment Rental Web Application**.
The project was executed in multiple well-defined phases to ensure
systematic development, timely completion, and quality output.

## Project Development Phases

### Phase 1: Requirement Analysis
- Identified the core problem in traditional house-hunting methods
- Analyzed user needs and system expectations
- Defined functional and non-functional requirements
- Studied feasibility and scope of the project

### Phase 2: System Design
- Designed the overall system architecture
- Planned frontend and backend interaction
- Designed database structure and data flow
- Finalized technology stack (MERN)

### Phase 3: Backend Development
- Developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js
- Implemented authentication and authorization using JWT
- Connected the application with MongoDB database
- Tested API endpoints using Postman

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
- Developed responsive UI using React.js
- Created reusable components for listings and dashboards
- Integrated frontend with backend APIs
- Implemented routing and protected routes

### Phase 5: Testing
- Performed functional testing of all modules
- Verified authentication and authorization flow
- Tested search, filter, and property detail features
- Fixed bugs and improved system stability

### Phase 6: Deployment and Documentation
- Finalized the complete application
- Verified system performance and security
- Prepared detailed project documentation
- Organized documentation phase-wise for submission

## Planning Strategy

The project followed a **modular and incremental approach**, where each
phase was completed and reviewed before moving to the next phase. This
approach helped in early detection of errors and smooth integration of
components.

## Outcome of Planning

- Clear development roadmap
- Efficient time management
- Reduced development risks
- Improved code quality and maintainability

This structured planning ensured the successful development of the
House Hunt system within the defined timeline.
